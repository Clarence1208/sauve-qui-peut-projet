### Description du project:

A rust project to solve a maze. 
The maze is generated by the server and the client will solve it.
You can either launch the professor server or our server to generate the maze.
Then you can launch the client to solve the maze.

### Clien side:

Basic algorithm is used to solve the maze. 
The algorithm is not smart and it will not find the shortest path.
It will follow the right wall to find the exit.
```bash
cargo run -- 127.0.0.1:8778
```


You can also use the smart algorithm to solve the maze.
The smart algorithm will try to find the shortest path to the exit.
It will find the closest cell available and move to it.
It will remember the cells that it has visited and will not visit them again.
```bash
cargo run -- 127.0.0.1:8778 -smart
```

### Server side:

```bash
cargo run --bin sqp-server -- --debug run --maze "5,5" --port 8778 --host-address 127.0.0.1
```
